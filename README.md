# histbook

Histogram library with better separation between aggregation and plotting.

## Motivation and introduction

The name deliberately draws from [CERN HBOOK](http://cds.cern.ch/record/307945/files/), a histogramming library developed for particle physics in the 1970's. Descendants and users of HBOOK, including [PAW](http://paw.web.cern.ch/paw/), [mn_fit](https://community.linuxmint.com/software/view/mn-fit), [HippoDraw](http://www.slac.stanford.edu/grp/ek/hippodraw/), [ROOT](https://root.cern/), [AIDA](http://aida.freehep.org/doc/v3.0/UsersGuide.html), and [YODA](https://yoda.hepforge.org/) have a three-step API not shared by histogramming functions developed outside of particle physics. These are:

   1. Define ("book") the bin widths and ranges of all your histograms.
   2. Increment ("fill") them with a large dataset.
   3. Visualize ("plot") them.

The advantage of explicit "booking" allows step 2 to be performed in parallel in one passâ€” essential for the scale of problems in particle physics. With fixed bins, histograms are [monoids](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/monoids-without-tears/) that can be combined by addition ([hadd](https://root.cern.ch/how/how-merge-histogram-files) in ROOT).

histbook takes this separation further by making the booking step independent of how the histograms might eventually be plotted. HBOOK and its descendants define one, two, and sometimes three-dimensional histograms because this is the highest dimensionality that can be visualized for human audiences. However, it's often useful to aggregate data along more dimensions, some categorically (pass/fail, unique strings), some sparsely, some with regular bin widths, some irregularly. Today, particle physicists manage this with arrays of histograms or naming conventions because the current frameworks only organize counters along one, two, or three dimensions.

histbook's booking step divides an arbitrary-dimensional parameter space into bins and generates an n-dimensional "fill" function. Collections of histograms can further be consolidated into a single "book." The result of filling does not produce a plot but a table of numbers that could be viewed as a [Numpy record array](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/basics.rec.html) or a [Pandas DataFrame](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/dsintro.html#dataframe). It can also be plotted in many different ways:

   * as a single distribution,
   * stacked by category,
   * overlaid,
   * as a trellis of side-by-side plots, etc.

In addition, post-aggregation analysis can be performed:

   * plot subsets of the data, as long as the threshold coincides with a bin edge,
   * compute ratios or fractions (e.g. trigger efficiency) with propagated uncertainties,
   * apply complex weighting schemes, including negative weights,
   * "profile plots" of one dimension by viewing it along another, etc.
